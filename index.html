			<li><b>Professional Background:</b> I have worked several different jobs spanning a variety of skill sets. 
				I love to learn new things, and learning on the job gets two birds with one stone! 
				I have worked retail, service, public works, farming, laboratory, desk, music, construction, woodworking, finance, and kitchen jobs.

			<li><b>Something to Remember Me By:</b> I spent a year of my life living in a school bus with no power or running water, while I worked on an off-grid, sustainable, permaculture farm.</li>
