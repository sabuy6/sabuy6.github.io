				<h2>About Sabu</h2>
				<p>Saburai Aquatics was founded in 2018 by Sabu Yamamoto.
					As a child, Sabu enjoyed catching crayfish and salamanders in the creeks surrounding his childhood home.
					That curiosity led to a lifetime of love for animals.</p>
				<p>Throughout his life, he has always found joy in observing nature, and that joy shows in his fishkeeping.
					Sabu found that most fish would breed when put in optimal settings, so, naturally, he began to pursue this goal.
					After successfully breeding several easy species, he has decided to try his hand at some more exquisite specimens.</p>
				<p>Today, Sabu keeps over 40 species of fish, and breeds over 20 of them.</p>
				<p>The name <a href="home.html"><strong class="companyname">Saburai Aquatics</strong></a> is a play on words, combining samurai with Sabu.
					As a Japanese-American, Sabu draws inspiration from the legendary samurai of Japanese lore.
					Just as the samurai were devoted to their craft, Sabu dedicates countless hours to the care and well-being of his fish.</p>
