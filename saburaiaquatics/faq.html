			<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
			<div class="faq">
			<h3>Shipping</h3>
			<dl>
				<dt>How often do you ship out fish?</dt>
				<dd>I ship every Monday.</dd>
				<dt>What is your DOA (dead on arrival) policy?</dt>
				<dd>For a full refund, pictures of dead fish or plants in original packaging (bags) must be sent to <a href="mailto:saburai.aquatics@gmail.com">saburai.aquatics@gmail.com</a> within an hour of delivery.</dd>
				<dt>What shipping service do you use?</dt>
				<dd>I generally use USPS, but I can use UPS if requested.</dd>
				<dt>How much does shipping cost?</dt>
				<dd>Shipping varies on the size and weight of each package.</dd>
				<dt>What is the best way to acclimate my fish</dt>
				<dd>We recommend a method known as drip acclimation. Empty the contents of your purchase into a large bucket, and then use an airline with a check valve to siphon water out of the quarantine tank at a rate of one drop every 5 seconds.</dd>
				<dt>Do I need to quarantine my fish?</dt>
				<dd>All of our fish are observed rigorously before shipping to ensure their health. However, it is <b>always</b> recommended that new fish be quarantined before being added to a tank. Shipping and acclimation are major stress factors that may cause fish to display symptoms that are not readily apparent in an optimal environment. While the fish may appear healthy in our tanks, it could be fighting off symptoms that present themselves under stressful conditions.</dd>

			<h3>Trivia</h3>
			<dl>
				<dt>How did you get into fish?</dt>
				<dd>My dad kept goldfish in ponds and tubs outside to eat mosquito larvae. I loved sitting by them and watching them.</dd>
				<dt>What is your favorite fish?</dt>
				<dd>I love corydoras. They have a ton of personality. There are hundreds of different species, and they come in several different colors. I love watching them sift through the sand for food.</dd>
