			<p class="phrase">The bushido standard of fishkeeping</p>
			<p>This website will showcase the high quality care that goes into proper selection and breeding of top quality fish. Our goal is to provide the best possible information alongside the best possible product in order to obtain the best possible results.</p>
			<h2>About</h2>
			<p>Saburai Aquatics was founded in 2018 by Sabu Yamamoto. As a child, Sabu enjoyed catching crayfish and salamanders in the creeks surrounding his childhood home. That curiosity led to a lifetime of love for animals.</p>
			<p>Throughout his life, he has always found joy in observing nature, and that joy shows in his fishkeeping. Sabu found that most fish would breed when put in optimal settings, so, naturally, he began to pursue this goal. After successfully breeding several easy species, he has decided to try his hand at some more exquisite specimens.</p>
			<p>Today, Sabu keeps over 40 species of fish, and breeds over 20 of them.</p>
			<h2>Albums</h2>
			<p>All photos and videos will be uploaded personally from my library. I may use stock google photos for demonstrations.</p>
