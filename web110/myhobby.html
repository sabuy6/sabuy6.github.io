				<h2>Playing the violin</h2>
				<p>As a child, my parents insisted that my siblings and I play a musical instrument. At times, I rebelled, but they persevered, and now I have been playing violin for almost 20 years.</p>
				<p>For the last eight years, I have chosen to voluntarily continue playing violin. It has now become a hobby of mine, as opposed to the chore that I despised as a child. Now, playing violin is a way for me to relax and reminisce on the beauty of my past. It calms my mind and allows me to express myself in ways that cannot be explained with words.</p>
				<p>Sometimes hobbies can make you money. In this case, I am able to use my violin skills to fill various needs. I play in churches, at weddings and social gatherings, and I even play in an orchestra. The orchestra is just for fun, but the others allow me to share my talent while picking up an extra paycheck. I rarely shy away from an opportunity to share my gift with others. Music is something better experienced by many. I can play alone any time I like, but it is truly a treat to play for an audience.</p>
				<p>I can honestly say that I appreciate all of the forced practice sessions and lessons that I endured as a child. My parents knew the benefits of playing an instrument, and they made sure that their kids were exposed to the world of music. I play my violin whenever I get a chance, and I enjoy every minute of it.</p>
